# My Rust Journey

Hey there!ü¶ù

This repository serves as my personal space for learning and exploring the Rust
programming language. Here, I'll be documenting my progress through small, often
daily, projects, each focused on understanding different concepts and features
of this language.

## What you'll find here

Each directory named dayX (e.g., day1, day2, etc.) represents a study session
or a code challenge. As I advance, these directories will contain the code
and resources related to what I've been learning that day.

## Rust: Why?

Mostly because i want to challenge myself in a high performance language
without a garbage collector. Its also the language most of the software
i use is written of nowadays.
